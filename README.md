app-common-ruby
=================

Simple client access library for the config for the Clowder operator.

Based on schema.json, the corresponding Ruby Classes are generated in types.rb.

Usage
-----

To access configuration, see the following example

```
require 'app-common-ruby'


function test() {
    if IsClowderEnabled() {
        console.Log("Public Port: %s", LoadedConfig.publicPort)
    }
}
```

The ``clowder`` library also comes with several other helpers

* ``KafkaTopics`` - returns a map of KafkaTopics using the requestedName
  as the key and the topic object as the value.
* ``KafkaServers`` - returns a list of Kafka Broker URLs.
* ``ObjectBuckets`` - returns a list of ObjectBuckets using the requestedName
  as the key and the bucket object as the value.
* ``DependencyEndpoints`` - returns a nested map using \[appName\]\[deploymentName\] 
  for the public services of requested applications. 
* ``PrivateDependencyEndpoints`` - returns a nested map using \[appName\]\[deploymentName\] 
  for the private services of requested applications.
